# Interpolation 
It allows you to define properties in a component class, and communicate these properties to and from the template.

# Property binding 
It's the same thing as interpolation, except you can set the properties and attributes of various HTML elements.

# Event binding 
It allows you to define events that occur in the template (user-initiated), and communicate to the component class.Â
